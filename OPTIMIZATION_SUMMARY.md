|------------|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Housing** | "Share your move-in experience at Aya Apartments!" | ‚ùå JOB-RELATED | ‚úÖ NON-JOB-RELATED | 97.0% |
| **Payment** | "Your credit card payment is scheduled" | ‚ùå JOB-RELATED | ‚úÖ NON-JOB-RELATED | 98.5% |
| **Service** | "Important updates to your Pro account usage limits" | ‚ùå JOB-RELATED | ‚úÖ NON-JOB-RELATED | 72.5% |
| **Moving** | "Zicheng, it's time to start planning your move..." | ‚ùå JOB-RELATED | ‚úÖ NON-JOB-RELATED | 85.5% |

### Performance Metrics
- **Training cost**: $0.07 total (OpenAI API for targeted labeling)
- **Data augmentation**: +15 targeted negative examples  
- **Final dataset**: 7,752 emails (7,737 original + 15 negatives)
- **Model confidence**: 85%+ on previously problematic cases

## üõ†Ô∏è Optimization Approach

### 1. Targeted Data Collection
- Used Gmail API to search for specific problematic email types
- Applied OpenAI GPT-3.5 for automated labeling ($0.002/classification)
- Collected 15 high-quality negative examples across 6 categories

### 2. Enhanced Feature Engineering
- **Job pattern detection**: High-impact positive indicators
- **Negative pattern matching**: Financial, housing, service email detection
- **Domain analysis**: Job sites vs service providers
- **Content structure**: Transactional vs conversational patterns

### 3. Anti-Overfitting Validation
- Tested on diverse samples (every 2nd email from 50 recent)
- Validated improvements generalize beyond small test sets
- Systematic evaluation at each optimization step

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Investment vs Returns
