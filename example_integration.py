1. Model Loading:
   - Load the model once at application startup
   - Store the classifier instance for reuse
   - Check health periodically

2. Error Handling:
   - Always check for 'error' key in results
   - Handle network/file system issues gracefully
   - Log errors for debugging

3. Performance:
   - Use batch processing for multiple emails
   - Consider async processing for large volumes
   - Monitor processing time and accuracy

4. Monitoring:
   - Track confidence score distributions
   - Monitor for accuracy degradation
   - Collect user feedback for improvement

5. Production Deployment:
   - Ensure model files are accessible
   - Set up health check endpoints
   - Implement proper logging
   - Consider model versioning
