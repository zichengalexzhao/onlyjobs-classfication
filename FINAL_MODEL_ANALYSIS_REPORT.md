## 5. Feature Engineering Success

### Generalization Strategy

#### 1. Name Tokenization
```
Before: "Hi Alex, thanks for applying to our Data Scientist position"
After:  "Hi USER_FIRST_NAME, thanks for applying to our Data Scientist position"
```

#### 2. Email Address Generalization  
```
Before: "Dear zicheng.zhao@gmail.com user"
After:  "Dear USER_EMAIL user"
```

#### 3. TF-IDF Feature Filtering
- Removed user-specific terms from vocabulary: `alex`, `zhao`, `zicheng`, etc.
- Focused on job-relevant vs non-job relevant language patterns
- Maintained semantic meaning while removing personal identifiers

#### 4. Enhanced User-Interaction Features
- `has_personalized_greeting`: Detects personalized salutations
- `has_user_name_mention`: Counts name references in content
- `has_user_email_mention`: Tracks email address usage patterns
- `thank_user_pattern`: Identifies gratitude expressions directed at user

### Why This Approach Works

✅ **Preserves Semantic Meaning:** Maintains the core patterns that distinguish job emails  
✅ **Removes Personal Specificity:** Eliminates user-dependent features  
✅ **Maintains Structural Patterns:** Keeps greeting/closing patterns that indicate job emails  
✅ **Focuses on Generalizable Language:** Emphasizes universal job-related terminology  
✅ **Creates Portable Features:** Works for any user's email patterns
